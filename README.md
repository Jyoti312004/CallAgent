## Overview

The system consists of:

1. **Voice AI Agent**: An AI-powered voice agent that can answer customer queries about the salon's services, working hours, staff, and policies.
2. **Knowledge Base**: A structured database of salon information that the AI agent can query.
3. **Escalation System**: When the AI can't answer a question, it automatically creates a support ticket for human supervisors.
4. **Supervisor Dashboard**: A web interface for human supervisors to view and respond to customer queries.
5. **Notification System**: Sends notifications to customers when their queries are resolved.
